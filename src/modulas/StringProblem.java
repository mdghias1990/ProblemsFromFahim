        // 1. Write a method that checks if two strings are equal, case sensitive.
        // (ex: "test" & "test" -> true; "Test" & "TEST" -> false; "TeSt" & "tEsT -> false; "TeSt" & "TeSt" -> true)

        // 2. Write a method that checks if two strings are equal, case insensitive.
        // (ex: "test", "test" -> true; "Test", "TEST" -> true; "TeSt" & "tEsT -> true; "TeSt" & "TeSt" -> true)

        // 3. Write a method that returns the first and last character of a given string, respectively.
        // (ex: "Brown" -> {'B', 'n'}; "monkey1" -> {'m', '1'})

        // 4. Write a method that checks if the length of a string is greater than or equal to 3.
        // (ex: "Uh" -> false; "Auditorium" -> true; "Man" -> true);

        // 5. Write a method that returns the number of words from a given string. Assume each word is separated by a space.
        // (ex: "This is a sample string" -> 5; "But why?" -> 2; "I cannot wait to go home and lay on my bed" -> 11)

        // 6. Write a method that returns the first three characters of a given string. Be wary about an edge case.

        // 7. Write a method that returns the last three characters of a given string. Be wary about an edge case.

        // 8. Write a method that concatenates the first and last three characters of a given string. Be wary about an edge case.

        // 9. Write a method that checks if the given string contains numerical values.

        // 10. Write a method that checks if the given string contains alphabetical characters.

        // 11. Write a method that will remove vowels from a given string.

        // 12. Write a method that returns the number of words from a given string.

        // 13. Write a method that returns the number of words from a file.

        // 14. Write a method that checks if a string is a palindrome.

        // 15. Write a method that checks if two strings are an anagram.

        // 16. Write a method that checks if a string contains duplicate characters.
